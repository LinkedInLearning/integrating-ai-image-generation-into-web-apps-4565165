Want to integrate image generation models into your JavaScript development workflow? Tune into this intermediate-level course and learn how to turn your ideas into high-resolution, photorealistic images with the power of AI. Instructor Sandy Ludosky covers methods for interacting with images provided by the OpenAI DALL·E 2 and DALL·E 3 models, focusing on creating original images from text prompts, editing and extending images, and generating variations of existing images. Sandy steps through how to use the Replicate API to run Stable Diffusion models, which are capable of generating photorealistic images from text inputs. She also provides hands-on exercises, challenging you to create an image gallery using React and generate videos from images using a research-only model.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
